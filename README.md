### Troubleshooting:
1. If by any chance on the first run ida doesn't ask you for your api key and **there are no errors in console**, that means that you've used wakatime plugins before and your apikey was already set in `~\.wakatime.cfg`

If you're reaching an unknown error you are free to open an issue.
